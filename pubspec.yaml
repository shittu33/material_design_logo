  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
#  assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg

  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
